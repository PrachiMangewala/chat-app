‚úîÔ∏è Introduction

# Introduction üìã

- The website is completely built on `Javascript` and `Node.js`.
- For the frontend I have used HTML and styled it using CSS.
- I have used `Socket.io` in this application for real time sending and receiving of messages.

This app is basically a whatsapp clone. A user enters the session by entering his/her name and he can communicate with people in that session. The app also notifies the other users when a new user has entered the chat room.

### Splash Logo

Note here that if you click [my portfolio](https://shourygupta28.github.io), you can see animating the logo at the beginning. I have designed that logo in [`Figma`](https://www.figma.com/) and then animated it using css.
Therefore, this part of portfolio is not customizable. But don't worry we have a solution to this problem. You have below two alternatives:

- If you want to design your own logo, then you can design it using `Figma` or `Adobe XD` or `Adobe Illustrator` or `Inkscape`. If you want to animate it, you can refer to `./src/components/Loader` directory which contains `js` and `css` files which animates the logo.
- If you don't want Splash screen or you don't know how to design logo, then this option is for you.

  - You can open `src/portfolio.js` file and at the top of this file you will see `settings` component as below:
  - ```javascript
    // Website related settings
    const settings = {
      isSplash: true,
    };
    ```
  - Change `isSplash` from `true` to `false`.
  - Now, if you see your website using `npm start`, it will directly open `home` rather than animating logo `splash` screen.
  - If you design your logo in future, then edit the files in `./src/components/Loader` and then revert `isSplash` to `true` in `src/portfolio.js`.

## Other

 - You need to change the website title and other descriptions in `public/index.html`
 
 - You can define your own favicon in `public/icons` directory. If you don't have a favicon, you can generate favicons from [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and [Favicon IO](https://favicon.io/)

 - Also you can edit your website preview known as description image. Run your site locally, take a screenshot and replace with `public/icons/desc.png`. Note that your screenshot should be 1280x640 for better preview


# Choose Theme üåà

- You can take a look at `src/theme.js` file where all available themes are mentioned with respective color codes.
- At the bottom of this file you will see the below code:
  - `export const chosenTheme = blueTheme;`
  - You need to change the name from `blueTheme` to whatever theme you want to set your website to.
  - You can define new theme similarly as other themes and you can assign name of that new defined theme to `chosenTheme`.
- That's it. You just need to change the theme name and the code will take care of everything else.

  Run `npm start` to check if everything is ok.

# Deployment üì¶

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

**Option 1:**

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository. That's it. Done.
  You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.

**Option 2 (will not work with [user pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)):**

- Run `npm run deploy` to build and create a branch called `gh-pages`. It will push the `build` files to that branch.
- The last step in deploying is to enable `Github Pages` in settings of the repository and select `gh-pages` branch.

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.  
If you are stuck somewhere and want to observe the deployment process in depth, then please watch the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwBS39TOmpA) here.
